# Lidar-Car-Detector
Senior year, I applied for an entrepreneurship class where I would develop and idea over the course of a school year. I decided to use my skills in engineering to help cyclists with "bike lash." Over the course of the school I researched and developed my idea into a working prototype. I created a sensor that would fit on the back of a cyclist's bike and notify them as a car approached from behind.

THINGS I LEARNED:
- Public speeking
- Presenting for money
- Fleshing out an idea and brainstorming
- How to use LIDAR Lite 3
- Programming ATTINY45's and how to use them with the sensor.
